        What is this?
    </span>
    <span class="eccsgl_bodytext">
        Good question. Welcome to the Extra Comfy CS:GO Lounge, or Extra Comfy CSGL (ECCSGL for short). <br/>
        <a href="www.csgolounge.com">CS:GO Lounge (CSGL)</a> is a site where you can bet ingame skins on professional CS:GO matches. <br/>
        ECCSGL is a simulated version of CSGL, where no real money is bet. It's a proving ground to hone your betting skills in safety. <br/>
    </span>

    <span class="eccsgl_subtitle">
        Who are you?
    </span>
    <span class="eccsgl_bodytext">
        I'm a computer scientist and newbie CS:GO bettor who wishes they had something like this when they started.
    </span>

    <span class="eccsgl_subtitle">
        Where do you get the data?
    </span>

    <span class="eccsgl_bodytext">
        Scraped directly from CSGOLounge, once a minute.
    </span>

    <span class="eccsgl_subtitle">
        How do I use this site?
    </span>
    <span class="eccsgl_bodytext">
        Not too differently to how you'd use CSGL. Go to the match list, click on the match you're interested in, and place a bet. <br/>
        You need an "account" first, which you can get by clicking on the "account page" link.
    </span>

    <span class="eccsgl_subtitle">
        What's in it for you?
    </span>

    <span class="eccsgl_bodytext">
        I have a big deadline and I've been procrastinating, I was bored, and it's a tool I wanted to make. <br/>
        If you want to donate though, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=230494219&token=cwNsBoOH">this is my Steam trade url.</a>
    </span>

    <span class="eccsgl_subtitle">
        What do I get if I <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=230494219&token=cwNsBoOH">donate</a>?
    </span>

    <span class="eccsgl_bodytext">
        A warm fuzzy feeling. I'm not offering any bonuses or anything, this is a tool, not anything else.

        But given this entire page is FAQs/tips, there's no real need for it to exist.
